# Milestone Project 1
![Recoil Wedding Band Logo](/assets/images/recoil-logo.png)

This project is based on a corporate events / wedding band that has a growing fan base in Ireland and the Uk. It is actually my own band that I set up 10 years ago but is no longer together and does not have an existing website.
I had alot of images and videos from different events of which I am the owner. I worked as a musician in the wedding and corporate events industry for almost 15 years and I was delighted to see this as an option for my first milestone project.

The main objectives for the site are to book more gigs and also gain more followers on social media. 
To achieve these goals I have included emotive and visual content to grab the users attention.
The site's layout allows for easy navigation to guide the user towards the best information that will lead to a conversion in the form of a direct booking or a contact form enquiry.

# UX

## UX Mock Ups:
To keep in line with the syle expected from weddings and corporate events I have kept the website design simple and clean with the main background being white with black text that is well spaced. 
I have relied on exciting images of live music and a red theme for the call to action buttons. 
I have used a fixed scrolling navigation menu to minimize user scrolling

The following link shows the mockups designed using [Balsamiq wireframes](/assets/wireframes/mockups.pdf)

### User Stories:
1. #### Companies - that are looking to book exciting corporate entertainment for an upcoming social or team building event.
1. #### Wedding couples - that are looking to book great live entertainment for their wedding reception.
1. #### Fans and followers - that know the band and have been to previous events but would like to find out more about the band and where to find and follow them on social media.

## User story 1 - Corporate Bookings
From research many small to medium size companies hold up to 3 social events and 10 team building events each business year. 
These can range from gala dinners to motivational speaking and of course the annual Christmas Party.

Each of these events require appropriate professional entertainment. 
The purpose of the website is to provide information on the band's experience with corporate entertainment while also showing the user a live video of the band in action entertaining at a large function. 
This shows the user they have come to right place and this band is the only band for their event.

From here the site will simply guide the user to fill out a contact form and proceed with a swift booking of the band based on availability. 
I understand that corporate users are very busy and have other commitments to their day, the
website's visual and text content assures them they are making the correct choice and can now focus their attention on other tasks.

## User story 2 - Wedding Couples
From researching the wedding industry I have seen that this is a very different type of user to corporate bookings. 

Many Brides and Grooms prefer to do most of their own planning and the planning in itself becomes a ritual in the 12 to 24 months leading up to a wedding. 
Couples wil create checklists and budgets starting from wedding dress and venue and work their way down to finer details of inviations and honeymoon destinations.
There are on average 20,000 weddings in Ireland alone each year with an average cost of â‚¬28000 for a wedding. 
My research suggests wedding couples use strict budgets and enjoy attending fairs and showcases which will include looking at a least 4 wedding bands.

With this in mind I am aware of creating an emotional response in wedding couples in order for them to commit to a booking. 
To do this I have laid out the website elegantly and simply with clean sharp imagery of the band conveying an exciting atmosphere. 
The live video is key here and the songs are very important. They must appeal to a wide tartget audience and come across as slick, exciting, charismatic and well rehearsed. 
At this point the site will guide the couples to complete a booking form or at the very least enquire about a possible booking.

## User story 3 - Fans and followers
This type of user is just as important as any other as one of the things potential clients will check is the band's social media accounts as it evokes trust and brand awareness. 
Potential clients will be looking at how many followers the band have aswell as extra images from past live events. It is vital I use the website to push the band's presence on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.

Many of the audiences from past events tend to follow on social media the next day and comment on pictures the band posts from the events they attended. 
I have decided the website is a great option to reinforce this behaviour. I have incorporated an ABOUT US page where visitors can learn more about each member of the band and any upcoming shows. 
To encourage new visitors landing on the website to follow the band on facebook  I have added social media icons in the footer aswell as embedded links to social media throughout the content.

I have implemented a single page site of 3 sectons:

1. The header also contains the band logo which has a return to home link.

I have used a fixed navigation bar to allow users to move to any other section from their current section. 
This creates a better user experience and avoids excessive scrolling. I have also implemented the use of embedding text links throughout sections of content that relates to other important content internally and externally such as the band's social media platforms.
The linking stucture keeps my user experience strategy in mind of generating conversions through contact form enquiries and social media followers.

## Surface

### Colors:
My theme has been kept extremely simple and is based on a white wedding.
Background colors have been kept to shades of white and off whites and silvers. The CTA buttons are a shade of deep red.
These colors convey the prominent themes of a traditional wedding. 
When brainstorming the main themes of a wedding the following things came to mind:
1. Wedding dress - Usually white and off white colors (main background theme)
1. Love - The most conventional symbol is the heart - red in color (Used on all CTA buttons)
2. Dining with friends and family - A huge part of a wedding is sitting down to an extravagant meal with loved ones and the first thing that came to my mind was cutlery.
I have used light greys and silvers in some sections to convey this.

### Fonts:
- For the headings I have used Playfair display in uppercase for its elegant style.
Headings that are on a background image are white to stand out more. And headings over paragraph sections have been left black.
- For the main text I have used Mulish with a back up of sans-serif at 18px. 
I used Mulish as it is very legible and also pairs well with Playfair Display.

### Images: 
All images have been taken from a live performance by a professional photographer called Mark Duffy. Please see [media](#media) for more info on Mark.
The images are bright and vibrant and really bring a sense of what a live performance by Recoil will be like for a potential client.

### Order and sequence:
1. Navigation order - Home/ About Us/ Contact US
1. Home section order - Hero image carousel/ Heading/ Intro paragraph/ Video
1. About Us section order - Hero image/  Heading and intro paragraph/ Meet the band profiles
1. Contact Us section order - Hero image/ Heading and paragraph/ Contact form/ Why us?
1. Footer section order - Band name/ social links/ contact details/ copyright

### Other themes:
1. Use of musical instrument icons from font Awesome for the meet the band section
1. Use of subtle shadows to lift some elements off the page


# Features:

### Home
The home page gives an over all synopsis on the band and also contains a video. The main goal is to encourage users to book through the contact form so I have embedded a link in the paragraph text to peak user interest and encourage an enquiry.
The home page consists of a bootstrap carousel of three hero images of the band performing live. As well as studying the bootstrap documentation I found a very helpfull youtube video to help with this function. Please see [credits](#credits) for full details. I have placed a "Learn More" CTA button to click directly to the contact form over the image and also another "Watch Now" CTA that brings the user to the video section.
The video on the home page encourages enagement and I have also embedded an external link below the video to the band's YouTube channel to encourage new suscribers.

### About us
The About US section consists of a hero image that contains details of the band's next show. To implement the next show sticker I found Code Institute's [Love Running](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+CSE101+2020_Q2/courseware/be0e510a3aca4bccb6e0bba4cf7cf06b/83c6c94d55f44c79a3646810d80ce7a3/) module very helpfull. 
The hero image also contains a "Meet the band" CTA button which brings the user to informative biographies on each band member. 
I have embedded an external link to the band's Facebook page to encourage new followers and the link text flows naturally with the context of the content. 
The band member profile again encourages engagement by bringing forth new information on each member. This is an interesting addition for both fans of the band and new users.

### Contact US 
The Contact Us section includes a hero image with a CTA button that brings the user directly to a simple contact form. Just three steps are available; Name> Email> Message. 
My intent to keep the contact form as simple as possible was to minimize cognitive overload and encourage users to reach out with either a direct booking being generated or a more general enquiry regarding price or upcomiing shows. 
A direct booking is the preferred outcome but I regard a general enquiry as a successful conversion as from here a narrative can begin with the band managment and a percentage of general enquiries can be seduced to a confirmed booking.

### Footer
I have added social media links and contact details in the footer. All footer location icons are clickable and work in external tabs.
I also added copyright details in a seperate bootstrap collumn. I played around with bootstrap's grid breakpoints to see what worked best on what devices.
Aswell as referring to bootstrap documentation I also found a very usefull YouTube video to help me implement the style I was looking for, please see [credits](#credits) for more details.
I then added my personal style preference in css.

### Features to add for future releases:
There are some features that I would love to implement on future releases:

#### 1. Availability calender - Allow the user to get instant feedback on availability by inputting their event details
#### 1. Live chat - This would be a great support option to engage with new users and reduce bounce rate and increase session times
#### 1. Virtual showcases - In today's world this would be an amazing option which would include an upcoming show notice and count down timer with the option for users to book their attendance to a virtual showcase. Users who have booked will be emailed a zoom link and a reminder notification when show is about to start.

# Testing:

## User story testing:

1. **As a HR assistant for a large company** I have been tasked with booking a professional band for the companies summer barbeque. 
Having searched some keywords on google the website for Recoil Wedding Band catches my eye. The website is quick to load and the landing page has an eye catching image of a well dressed five piece act that look like professionals in their field.
I am intrigued. The landing page hero image has a button that says "Watch Now" on clicking I am brought to a very slick and professional video of the band showcasing an amazing performance of songs that will definatley fill the dancefloor.
I am tempted to get in touch and on clicking Contact US I am presented with a simple three step contact form. I input my event details and a swift reply on availability allows me to book there and then.

1. **As a bride** seeking the perfect band to entertain my guests at my wedding reception I begin my online search. On entering the Recoil Wedding Band webise I find the layout simple, elegant and easy to navigate.
The text content is not overwheling yet it is informative. I would like to see and hear how the band sounds. The "Watch Now" button brings me to an excellent live video. From here I am interested in finding out more about each band member.
The fixed navigation means I never have to scroll to the top and the menu is always one click away. I click on About Us and I am brought to a meet the band section that has a photo and bio on each band member. Having felt I have gottent to know the band I now would like to get in touch. I click on the "Get in Touch" button below the meet the band section and I am brought to a contact form.
I fill out the form and begin correspondance with the band.

1. **As a fan** I would like to know more about Recoil Wedding Band and when they have their next show. On scrolling the webiste and reading lots of informative information
there are many embedded links in the text that bring me to other resources such as the band's YouTube channel. I have never seen some of the videos on there and decide to like and suscribe I also tell my friends about it.
These links open in external tabs so finding my way back to the website is easy. In the About Us section I could cleary see a notice about the band's next upcoming show and I made a note in my calender. In the footer I find Social media icons and on clicking I find the band has a strong presence on Facebook and Instagram. There is also extra content on here that I have never seen before so I like and suscribe and also tell my friends about it.
The next time I visit the band's social media I notice their fanbase has grown rapidly.

# Manual Testin:

#### Responsive design:
* I also carried out exstensive user testing and consistently checked links and multiple screen sizes on different devices.
Although I have used bootstrap I did notice that on a mobile screen my hero images didnt show the full scope that the desktop screen showed. 
I experimented with media queries to allow the images to fill the divs on mobile screens however this meant my titles and CTA buttons that were overlayed on hero images would also need to reduce in size. 
However I did not like how this looked. I decided to not show The CTA buttons on mobile but this did not align with my ux design as most visitors use mobile devices. 
After researching other popular sites and checking their websites on different screen sizes I found that their website was similar full width background images although not showing all the content as on desktop still looked great. 

#### Call to action buttons:
* I checked and rechecked all buttons were working on all devices and were leading to the correct sections of the website. I was also important that I layed out 
my CTA choices in order of priorty to my user stories with a button to find a live video and a button for the contact form being the most important.

#### Bootstrap break points:
I applied media queries for my font awesome icons to display in block format only smaller screens and I checked this on all devices.

#### Contact form:
I used a background image of spotlights which I made in photoshop to give and effect of lighting up the contact form. 
This looked great on desktop and larger devices however it looked cluttered on smaller screens so I decided to used a simple background color on small devices and implemented this with a media query.
I also exstensively tested the contact form. Making sure all of my "required" attribute were working. The from would not send if a field was left empty or did not contain the correct format of information such as a valid email address.

#### External links:
I made sure to check that all links and social media links were directed to the correct URLS and also that my target="_blank" attribute was working. 
All external links open in a new browser tab.

#### Email and phone:
I also added a mailto: link to and telephone: link to a working email address and phone number and testing to make sure they were working.
When clicked the email icon opens my email tab and the emais are sending to the assigned source. When the phone icon is clicked desktop opens skype and mobile makes a direct call.


# HTML and CSS validation and fixes:
1. I used [W3C CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) to test and check my CSS code. I luckily had no issues to find and fix. 

![W3C CSS test](/assets/images/w3c-css.png)

1. I used [W3C HTML validation service](https://validator.w3.org/) to test and check my HTML code. There were some errors with not enough headings as seen in image.
