                                    of experience performing in some of the best wedding bands on the scene. He started
                                    as a young lad in an AC DC tribute band. Because Johnny is a one man band there are
                                    no limits to the genres Picture Perfect can do justice to and most importantly there
                                    are no backing tracks. What you see is what you hear.
