                                    instruments, Johnny could open his own guitar shop in the morning but he chooses
                                    instead to bring all his equipment to Picture Perfect gigs!. Johnny has many years
                                    of experience performing in some of the best wedding bands on the scene. He started
                                    as a young lad in an AC DC tribute band. Because Johnny is a one man band there are
                                    no limits to the genres Picture Perfect can do justice to and most importantly there
                                    are no backing tracks. What you see is what you hear.
